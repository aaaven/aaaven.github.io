"DaDA" is an interactive project explores the possible role of artificial intelligence in (traditionally human oriented) creative processes --such as drawing and design. A cooperative relation between human and AI in this interactive progress is expected. Human creator not only trains AI with artificial data but also benefits from the assistance of AI. On the other side, artificial intelligence not only learns from human created data but also "teaches" and provides human creator new approaches to expected or unexpected creative goals.
