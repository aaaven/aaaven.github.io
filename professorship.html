            <p class="description">
                Artists and other professional creative participants should conduct research as in other fields, so to
                enhance and advance their practices. In my personal experiences, written research is guided through
                cumulative stages of critical reflection and/or interpretive analysis of my practices. I intend to
                develop art projects for specific research question(s) that I want to investigate. Led by research
                questions, I dedicate to conduct a combination of praxis and thinking, where writing actively
                contributes to the creative work itself, functioning as an integral part of the overall research. Both
                culminate the research deliver as exhibited artwork and submission of creative research writing that
                best articulates and reflects ideas. In brief, the creative work is the research itself together with a
                written component informing research.
                <br><br>
                <b>Create with Artificial Intelligence</b><br><br>
                My general practice and research interests spread in interactive media, generative art and machine
                vision for arts applications. And recently, I focus on utilizing artificial intelligence/machine
                learning to create art and have been directed by three questions: 
                <br><br>
                1. can Artificial Intelligence be creative?
                <br>
                2. can we design AI to collaborate with and facilitate, enhance human creativity?
                <br>
                3. and how could the Chinese cultural heritage be involved and evolved?

                <strong>Creative Practices with Emerging Technology.</strong>
                <br><br>
                If I use one phrase to summarise my practice, it would be creative practices with emerging
                technology. I keep improving and enhancing my creative approach and artistic medium with the up-to-date
                technology advancements includes:
                <br><br>
                1. interactive media technologies such as creative coding and physical computing;<br>
                2. generative algorithms;<br>
                3. more recently, creative artificial intelligence.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Interactive:: after Artificial Intelligence:</strong>
                <br><br>
                My practice and projects vary in terms of the underlying technology and presenting format, but they
                mostly share one common feature - “interactive” and focus on human-machine interaction.
                <br><br>
                With strong recent interests in cultural innovation and creative artificial intelligence, I've created a
                project series titled “Chinese New Literati, 2018 - ”, this installations series includes both
                screen-based and physical interactive experiences, and all engage participants to interact with the
                system(s). This one
                series generally aims at assisting users to create, enjoy and appreciate Chinese traditional arts and
                culture. These recent works are categorized as <strong>"project:: after AI"</strong> <a
                    href="index.html">here</a>.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Interactive:: Before Artificial Intelligence:</strong>
                <br><br>
                Earlier projects of mine were more physical, and focusing on interactive media and generative algorithms:<br>
                -- the generative progress, the algorithms and how participants and machine response/interact;<br>
                -- the generated appearance, such as presenting format of the result eg., digital fabrication.<br>
                These previous works are categorized as <strong>"project:: before AI"</strong> <a
                    href="index.html">here</a>.

                <strong>Create with Artificial Intelligence:</strong>
                <br><br>
                Obviously enough, the application of artificial intelligence as an artistic medium has re-shaped my
                approach towards art, and its significant influences went far beyond. In order to exam and ease my and
                others' concerns and excitements of artificial intelligence, my statement of artificial intelligence in
                the name of art is Create with Artificial Intelligence. more details in the <a

            <p class="description">
                If I use one word to summarize my teaching philosophy, it's practice. I believe practice is the key to
                both teach and learn creative art and technology. I teach what I practice. I summarize and include my
                in-field successful or temporary failed attempts in the syllabus and keep students updated with the most
                current trends and state-of-art technology advancements. I encourage and guide students towards
                self-directed projects. I engage them to develop their concept and technical skills, and build
                individual artwork as practices.
                <br><br>
                I develop and teach undergraduate and graduate creative technology driven art and design curriculum. I
                currently teach Interactive Media Arts (IMA) in various institutions. In my recent roles, I taught
                courses on how to apply emerging media to create arts at NYU Shanghai and Shanghai JIAO TONG University
                (SJTU). Before that, I taught new media arts fundamentals and advanced studio courses at Shanghai Arts
                and Design Academy (SADA) as an adjunct, and I was a resident research fellow of IMA at NYU Shanghai for
                four years.

            <p class="description">
                All my courses focus on how to apply emerging technology, such as creative coding, creative AI and other
                interactive technologies, to produce art and design. For example (updated 11/2019):
                <br><br>
                1. In “Artificial Intelligence Arts, F2019” and “Interactive Machine Learning, S2019” at NYU Shanghai, I
                taught students how to apply creative AI software and coding framework to design and develop interactive
                projects. Through 14 weeks’ learning, students learn both conceptual and technical knowledge through
                practices and succeed in the class with individual projects. There is one student building an
                “interactive newspaper” in which an AI algorithm generates caption of what camera sees in real-time and
                updates the headline of her re-designed “New York Times” newspaper title! Or another student project
                titled “A-Imitation” which is a magic mirror and transfer anyone in front of the camera to paintings
                like “The Scream” or “Starry Night”. Or other projects like websites can generate tattoos, and anime
                faces.
                <br><br>
                2. In “Digital Arts, S2019” at SJTU, I taught (master) students with minimal background both the basics
                of creative coding and physical computing first and then ran the rest of class as design studios to help
                them develop projects. Thirteen students are broken into six groups and all managed to present their
                creative projects at the end of semester show. One group built an interactive installation for social
                good with Arduino, which is a toilet paper dispenser connected to a computer and screen. Along with the
                action of taking the paper, the virtual tree on the screen will fall leaves. If an unreasonable amount
                of paper is taken at one time, the tree will shrivel and awake the environment-friendly mind. Another
                student project tries to backup the LGBT group with screen-based interactive experiences. When
                approaching the end of the interactive story, the participant will receive one rainbow marked profile
                photo. Other projects also use different technology, such as Kinect, to build projection mapping for
                various interactive experiences.
                <br><br>
                3. “See Through Kinect, S2018”, “Interactive Installation, S2017” and “Integrated Design Studio, F2016”
                are similar courses I taught at SADA as advanced interaction design courses, aim to teach design
                background students how to apply hardware like Kinect, Leap Motion and Arduino to build interactive
                projects. Some students create interactive installation to advertise different product like participants
                can follow the pose instruction and dance in front of the “window” and get the virtual snack package, or
                participants can catch the virtual canny in screen through waving their hands in air, or participants
                just simply enjoy interacting with the Funny M&M's Characters. Some other projects also address broader
                social issues like calling for attention to people who need help, elder, young children and disabled.
                One student project applies Arduino to a bench and connects to a screen. (only) when the participant
                sits down, the virtual character - an old man - will hug the participant virtually. And there is another
                group designed an ultrasonic powered white cane and use sound feedback to remind the user when needed.
                <br><br>
                4. I also have the ability and experience to teach interactive media fundamentals, such as "Interaction
                Lab, 2015 - 2017" and "Make Design Interact, S2016, F2017" at NYU Shanghai and SADA. These courses
                usually teach freshman students with low computer literacy and hone their interactive media
                fundamentals. Besides that, during my first two year's fellowship at NYU Shanghai, I led the design and
                teaching of the "Digital Fabrication" course at NYU Shanghai and set up the digital fabrication lab
                which contains several 3D printers, CNC milling machines, and one laser-cutter.
