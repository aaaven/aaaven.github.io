                    Digital Fabrication is the process of using design of modeling software to generate digital files which can then be physically produced through a variety of methods,
                    including laser cutting, 3D printing and computer numeric control (CNC).
                    In this class students will learn how to design and model for and to operate fabrication machines.Emphasis will be put on designing functional parts or components being successful on a conceptual and aesthetic level.
                    In this class students will discover methods to design and model using computer aided design (CAD) software.
                    Students will then learn to utilize computer aided manufacturing (CAM) software to operate machines to fabricate designs.

                    "Make Design Interact" is a foundation course targeting at design students with zero knowledge in "technology".
                    For some unknown reason, experienced designers always regard technology (programming and electronics)
                    as some fantastic but miserable methods can produce cool products and artworks, but hard to learn and get started.
                    With all previous concerns, "Make Design Interact" is made to build students confidence on hands-on technology including coding,
                    electronics and fabrication, get them comfortable and enjoy making, and gain knowledge of interactive technology and design.
