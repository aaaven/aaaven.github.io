            <h2><strong>Teaching Philosophy</strong></h2>
            <p class="description">
                If I use one word to summarize my teaching philosophy, it's practice. I believe practice is the key to both teach and learn creative art and technology. I teach what I practice. I summarize and include my in-field successful or temporary failed attempts in the syllabus and keep students updated with the most current trends and state-of-art technology advancements. I encourage and guide students towards self-directed projects. I engage them to develop their concept and technical skills, and build individual artwork as practices.
            </p>    
            <p class="description">
                I have been developing and teaching undergraduate and graduate creative art and technology curriculum for the past four years. I have taught Artificial Intelligence (AI) Arts, Computational Arts and Interactive Media Arts (IMA) in various institutions including IMA Program at NYU Shanghai, Institute of Cultural and Creative Industry (ICCI) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (USC-SJTU, jointly established with University of Southern California), School of Professional Studies (NYUSPS) at NYU Shanghai and New Media Program at WPP School of Marketing and Communications, Shanghai (WPP School).

                    Kinect is a game device delivered with microsoft's console Xbox but hackers and makers take it more as hackable body and gesture control sensor for physical computing and computer vision projects.
                    In this class, student will learn advanced programing knowledge like object oriented programming,
                    as well as deep understanding of mentioned video equipment and combine these together and create new interfaces, installation or artistic media presentations.

                    In 2014, consumers spent more than $21 Billion on video games worldwide.
                    Video games, an integral part of our culture, are created by some of the most innovative minds in the technology sector.
                    This intensive game-design course gives students both a conceptual understanding of game design and practical experience in the design and development of games.
                    During this game-creation intensive, students work in collaboration to study, design, and create interactive digital games.
                    The emphasis of this course is placed on creating alternative physical interfaces that can be designed utilizing Arduino microcontroller, sensors and switches in order to create new user experiences.

                    "Make Design Interact" is a foundation course targeting at design students with zero knowledge in "technology".
                    For some unknown reason, experienced designers always regard technology (programming and electronics)
                    as some fantastic but miserable methods can produce cool products and artworks, but hard to learn and get started.
                    With all previous concerns, "Make Design Interact" is made to build students confidence on hands-on technology including coding,
                    electronics and fabrication, get them comfortable and enjoy making, and gain knowledge of interactive technology and design.
