                    Digital Fabrication is the process of using design of modeling software to generate digital files which can then be physically produced through a variety of methods, including laser cutting, 3D printing and computer numeric control (CNC). The ability to fabricate directly from our computers or design files used to be an exotic and expensive option not widely available, but recent changes within this field have brought these capabilities to within our reach. In this class students will learn how to design and model for and to operate fabrication machines. Emphasis will be put on designing functional parts that can fit into a larger project or support other components as well as being successful on a conceptual and aesthetic level. In this class students will discover methods to design and model using computer aided design (CAD) software. We will then utilize computer aided manufacturing (CAM) software to generate instructions that various machines can follow to fabricate our designs. We will also look at methods for 3D scanning, data manipulation and conversion, mold making, as well as printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication

                    Make Design Interact is a foundation course created for a design program doing New Media and Communication, targeting at sophomore students who have already done some design foundation but with zero knowledge on “technology”. For some unknown reason, designers, especially those who have had rich design experiences will regard technology, refers to programming and electronics, as fantastic magical and miserable methods can easily produce cool designs and artworks, but also feel it is extremely hard to learn and get started. And so do those young design students. With all those concerns, “Make Design Interact” is made to build students confidence on hands-on technology including coding, electronics and fabrication, get them feel comfortable and enjoy making and prototyping, and also gain well understandings of interactive technology and design senses.<br>
