                <strong>Creative Practices with Emerging Technology.</strong>
                <br><br>
                If I use one phrase to summarise my practice, it would be creative practices with emerging
                technology. I keep improving and enhancing my creative approach and artistic medium with the up-to-date
                technology advancements includes:
                <br><br>
                1. interactive media technologies such as creative coding and physical computing;<br>
                2. generative algorithms;<br>
                3. more recently, creative artificial intelligence.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Interactive:: after Artificial Intelligence:</strong>
                <br><br>
                My practice and projects vary in terms of the underlying technology and presenting format, but they
                mostly share one common feature - “interactive” and focus on human-machine interaction.
                <br><br>
                With strong recent interests in cultural innovation and creative artificial intelligence, I've created a
                project series titled “Chinese New Literati, 2018 - ”, this installations series includes both
                screen-based and physical interactive experiences, and all engage participants to interact with the
                system(s). This one
                series generally aims at assisting users to create, enjoy and appreciate Chinese traditional arts and
                culture. These recent works are categorized as <strong>"project:: after AI"</strong> <a
                    href="index.html">here</a>.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Interactive:: Before Artificial Intelligence:</strong>
                <br><br>
                Earlier projects of mine were more physical, and focusing on interactive media and generative algorithms:<br>
                -- the generative progress, the algorithms and how participants and machine response/interact;<br>
                -- the generated appearance, such as presenting format of the result eg., digital fabrication.<br>
                These previous works are categorized as <strong>"project:: before AI"</strong> <a
                    href="index.html">here</a>.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Create with Artificial Intelligence:</strong>
                <br><br>
                Obviously enough, the application of artificial intelligence as an artistic medium has re-shaped my
                approach towards art, and its significant influences went far beyond. In order to exam and ease my and
                others' concerns and excitements of artificial intelligence, my statement of artificial intelligence in
                the name of art is Create with Artificial Intelligence. more details in the <a
