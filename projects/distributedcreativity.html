            * Still an early exploration of ideas.

            “Distributed Creativity“ is an experiment explores different ways to create and the meaning behind. The experiment runs as an artist workshop and the participants learn the basics of AI and follow ruleset to perform a collaborative creation under AI's help. The artist, participants & the AI are complementary, contributions are distributed in the process, and hopefully, nobody is leading.            
            <br><br>
            The idea of "Distributed Creativity" came from a fun exploration of BigGAN and some discussion on social networks. On a sunny autumn afternoon, I figured out how to interpolate bigGAN and obtain a smooth transformation from one generated image to another, all by a smooth walk in the latent space. I got some video like this:
            <br><br>
            <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/376646514" width="800" height="800" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
            <br><br>
            Or from this vase to another!
            <br><br>
            <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/376646591" width="800" height="800" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <br><br>
            I posted it on my Wechat, got the most questions about how did I generate the images in between and what kind of parameters I am using to make/guide the smooth transformation while I didn't control it at all. All my input to the system is the starting and ending point, all the rest are decided by the algorithm.  
            <br><br>
            That's how the started to think, the creative process is distributed, I, as a creator, didn't do more (important) work than the AI.
            <br><br>
            Inspired by collaborative art, I want to push the boundary further. What if I make the few-enough decisions more distributed and introduce in more "decision-nodes", here is a ruleset based collaborative art project I created in my <a href='https://wp.nyu.edu/shanghai-ima-aiarts'>AI Arts</a> class at NYU Shanghai: Distributed Creativity. 
            <br><br>
            Here the first try with my students:
            <br><br>
            <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/374610631" width="800" height="587.5" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <br><br>
            And the rulesets we've been using:
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            More explorations on the way!
