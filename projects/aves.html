            <p>Aves is a software and tool I build (mainly) for architects who use grasshopper and have the needs to implement a flocking system.
            This project conceptualizes from my experience as an architecture student doing Mercedes Benz 4S shop design project.
            I had the idea of generating the architecture plan layout with a human crowd simulation but I could not find any satisfying method I can achieve with no programing knowledge.
            And my first ever "big" coding project during auditing IMA foundation class "Interaction Lab"(lead by IMA professor Matthew Belanger, this class is also my first bite on creative coding and interactive media)
