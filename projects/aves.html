        <p class="description">
            Aves is a software and tool built for architects who use grasshopper and have the needs to implement a
            flocking system.

        <p class="description">
            The idea comes from my experience as an architecture student doing Mercedes Benz 4S shop design; I had the
            idea of generating the architecture's layout(plan) based on a simulation of users' movement and behavior.
            But no easy and satisfying method was find especially with no programing knowledge.
            <br><br>
            After joined IMA, I got the opportunity to audit IMA foundation class "Interaction Lab"(lead by IMA
            professor Matthew Belanger) and also learned how to program.
            As final project of this class, I implemented the flocking system in processing and make it available to
            grasshopper and rhino through OSC protocol.
            <br><br>
            Aves, as a software, is developed based on the course work with better constructed code and a well designed
            interface.

        <p class="description">
            The original processing sketch as Interaction Lab course project implemented a flocking
            system in two dimension.
            <br>
            And it follows flocking rules:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)#Flocking_rules">(more
            details on flocking wiki.)</a>
        <ul>
            <li> Separation - avoid crowding neighbors(short range repulsion).</li>
            <li> Alignment - steer towards average heading of neighbors.</li>
            <li> Cohesion - steer towards average position of neighbors (long range attraction).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <img src="../images/projects/aves/first_prototype.gif" width="800">

        <p class="description">
            According to flocking rules mentioned previously, this sketch also have 3 parameters to control the
            separation, alignment and cohesion respectfully.
            <br>
            Since the idea is to create a tool which can simulate flocking behavior for architecture design purpose, the
            first move is to make it in 3D.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
            Another experiment has been made during the development is to keep the trail of each boid and create a 3 dimensional sculpture.
        </p>

        <img src = "../images/projects/aves/3d_trial.jpg" width="800">

        <p class="description">
            Then OSC component is introduced and will send current boids' location to Grasshopper client with OSC protocol.
            In order to make it work as a tool and software, a graphic interface then been designed.
        </p>

        <img src = "../images/projects/aves/add_gui_02.jpg" width="400">

        <p class="description">
            After the main structure is done, I spent more time finalizing the interface design and implementation.
        </p>

        <img src="../images/projects/aves/final_design.jpg" width="800">

        <p class="description">
            In <a href="http://www.grasshopper3d.com/">grasshopper</a>(and plugin <a href = "http://www.food4rhino.com/app/ghowl">ghowl</a>),
            a structured OSC message will be received and contains current boids' location data.
            Thus, a flocking system can be implemented with few programming work and ready for further development and creation.
