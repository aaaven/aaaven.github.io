                Aves is a software and tool built for architects who use grasshopper and have the needs to implement a flocking system.

                The idea comes from my experience as an architecture student doing Mercedes Benz 4S shop design; I had the idea of generating the architecture's layout(plan) based on a simulation of users' movement and behavior.
                But no easy and satisfying method was find especially with no programing knowledge.
                <br><br>
                After joined IMA, I got the opportunity to audit IMA foundation class "Interaction Lab"(lead by IMA professor Matthew Belanger) and also learned how to program.
                As final project of this class, I implemented the flocking system in processing and make it available to grasshopper and rhino through OSC protocol.
                <br><br>
                Aves, as a software, is developed based on the course work with better constructed code and a well designed interface.
