                Creative practices with emerging technology.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
            If I use one phrase to summarise my practice and teaching, it would be creative practices with emerging technology. I keep improving and enhancing my creative approach and artistic medium with the up-to-date technology advancements includes:<br><br>
            1. interactive media technologies such as creative coding and physical computing; <br>
            2. generative algorithm arts;<br>
            3. and more recently, creative artificial intelligence.<br><br>
            My practice and projects vary in terms of the underlying technology and presenting format, but they mostly share one common feature - “interactive” and focus on human-machine interaction. With strong recent interests in cultural innovation and creative artificial intelligence, I've created a project series titled “Chinese New Literati, 2018 - ”, this installations series includes both screen-based and physical interactive experiences, and all engage participants to interact with the system(s). This one series generally aims at assisting users to create, enjoy and appreciate Chinese traditional arts and culture. More details in the <a href="artistStatement.html">artist statment</a> and <strong>"project:: after AI"</strong> on <a href="index.html">main-page</a>.
            <br><br> 
            Earlier projects of mine were more physical, and focusing more on the generative result and process, such as the algorithms behind the generative processes and in what format to present the generated results eg., digital fabrication. These works are categoried as <strong>"project:: before AI"</strong>. 
            <br><br>
            Obviously enough, the application of artificial intelligence as an artistic medium has re-shaped my approach towards art, and its significant influnences went far beyond. In order to exame and ease my and others' concerns and excitements of artificial intelligence, my statement of artificial intelligence in the name of art is <strong>Create with Artificial Intelligence</strong>.

                    One glance (惊鸿一瞥) is a webcam based interactive pixel manipulation project.
                    It interacts with user and draws a particle system follows mouse motion and presents as animated
                    Long
                    (Chinese dragon) or neuron -like pattern.
                    Meanwhile the estimated pattern works as mirror and shows (partially) captured webcam image.

                    process of taking picture;
                    since people mostly take pictures only for interesting or special moments.
