            <p class="description">
                Artists and other professional creative participants should conduct research as in other fields, so to
                enhance and advance their practices. In my personal experiences, written research is guided through
                cumulative stages of critical reflection and/or interpretive analysis of my practices. I intend to
                develop art projects for specific research question(s) that I want to investigate. Led by research
                questions, I dedicate to conduct a combination of praxis and thinking, where writing actively
                contributes to the creative work itself, functioning as an integral part of the overall research. Both
                culminate the research deliver as exhibited artwork and submission of creative research writing that
                best articulates and reflects ideas. In brief, the creative work is the research itself together with a
                written component informing research.

                <b>Create with Artificial Intelligence</b><br><br>
                My general practice and research interests spread in interactive media, generative art and machine
                vision for arts applications. And recently, I focus on utilizing artificial intelligence/machine
                learning to create art and have been directed by three questions: 
                <br><br>
                1. can Artificial Intelligence be creative?
                <br>
                2. can we design AI to collaborate with and facilitate, enhance human creativity?
                <br>
                3. and how could the Chinese cultural heritage be involved and evolved?
