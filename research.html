    <h2>Research Statement</h2>
    <p class = "description">
        Artists and other professional creative participants should conduct research as in other fields, so to enhance and advance their practices. In my personal experiences, written research is guided through cumulative stages of critical reflection and/or interpretive analysis of my practices. I intend to develop art projects for specific research question(s) that I want to investigate. Led by research questions, I dedicate to conduct a combination of praxis and thinking, where writing actively contributes to the creative work itself, functioning as an integral part of the overall research. Both culminate the research deliver as exhibited artwork and submission of creative research writing that best articulates and reflects ideas. In brief, the creative work is the research itself together with a written component informing research.

        <b>Create with Artificial Intelligence</b><br><br> My general practice and research interests spread in interactive media, generative art and machine vision for arts applications. And recently, I focus on utilizing artificial intelligence/machine learning to create art and have been directed by three questions:Â 
    </p>
    <p class = "description">
        1. Can Artificial Intelligence be Creative?
        <br>
        2. Can We Design AI to Better Collaborate with and Facilitate, Enhance Human Creativity or Can We Create with AI?
        <br>
        3. And How could the Chinese Cultural Heritage Be Involved and Evolved?
